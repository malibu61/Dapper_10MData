👋 Hello everyone!
This Project is a data-intensive project developed with Dapper and ASP.NET Core MVC, as part of the Full Stack .NET Core Development training program at MY YAZILIM EĞİTİM AKADEMİ DANIŞMANLIK, under the guidance of instructor Murat Yücedağ. In this project, I used Ömer Çolakoğlu’s Kaggle dataset with 10 million records. 📊

💡 Project Overview:
I developed a dashboard to visualize large-scale sales data through a web interface. I used modern charts (Pie, Bar, Doughnut, Radar, Bubble) and added pagination support. Additionally, I integrated OpenAI API for AI-powered data analysis and made meaningful statistical insights from the data. I also added a searching feature to allow users to search data more quickly and efficiently.

🧰 Technologies & Tools:

💻ASP.NET Core MVC (6.0)

🗄️Dapper, SQL Server

🧠OpenAI API (AI-powered analysis)

📈Chart.js, LINQ & SQL
